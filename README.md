# cloud.gov Precompiled CRAN (cflinuxfs3-CRAN)

Due to the 15 minute timeout on buildpacks and the lack of precompiled R packages for linux, R buildpack applications often fail to deploy. To resolve this issue, we have created the cflinuxfs3-CRAN repository.

## Requesting new packages

Request any packages you need added in an [issue](../../issues) and a maintainer will review your request. If a package is not in the standard CRAN, please provide its location.

Licensed members of the USEPA org can also request packages using the workflow dispatch in the Actions tab.

## How to use this CRAN in cloud.gov
To use this, start your r.yml file with the lines:
```
packages:
- cran_mirror: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USEPA/cflinuxfs3-CRAN/master/cflinuxfs3/
```
